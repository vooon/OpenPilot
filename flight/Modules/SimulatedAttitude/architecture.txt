Setting up the link from our FreeRTOS simulation to a Matlab model is not
straightforward.

1. Create model in matlab however desired (in this case using control toolbox).
Compile to a shared library.  However, this library will communicate with mx
primitves which we don't want to place as a dependency on the simulator.

2. Create a driver layer.  This will be another shared library, however it will
have a simple interface to the FreeRTOS simulator that uses a common structure
to pass the simulation state between the FreeRTOS code and the matlab code.

3. Compile driver and matlab libraries and place in build directory.  Need to
add DYLIB path to loading the Matlab MCR system.
